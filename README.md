# Handwritten-To-Text-EMNIST

Handwritten-To-Text-EMNIST is a machine learning project that uses the EMNIST dataset to recognize handwritten text and convert it to digital text. The EMNIST dataset consists of a set of images of handwritten characters, as well as their corresponding labels.

# Installation

To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system, along with the following libraries:

    numpy
    keras
    tensorflow
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip, like so:

```
pip install numpy keras tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can download the code from this repository and run it on your machine.

# Usage

To use this project, simply open the Handwritten_to_Text.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment. The notebook is divided into several sections, each of which contains code for a different step in the process of recognizing handwritten text. You can run each section of the notebook in order to see the results of each step.

The notebook contains code for preprocessing the EMNIST dataset, training a machine learning model on the dataset, and using the model to recognize handwritten text. The final section of the notebook demonstrates how to use the model to recognize handwritten text from a sample image.
